    ## What are the things that a potential home buyer considers before purchasing a house? The location, the size of the property, schools, parks, restaurant, hospitals, etc. What about the most important factor -- the price ðŸ¤‘? 

    ## The End-goal of this project is to give an estimate of how much prices a house will have on the basis of features like Size of a House, Location and etc. This Machine learning project was a regression problem statement in order to get best accuracy I have used GradientBoostingRegressor to solve the problem which gave r2_score of 78% after tuning parameters.
