# Predicting-House-Prices-In-Bengaluru
What are the things that a potential home buyer considers before purchasing a house? The location, the size of the property, schools, parks, restaurant, hospitals, etc. What about the most important factor -- the price? 

## Objective
The End-goal of this project is to give an estimate of how much prices a house will have on the basis of features like Size of a House, Location and etc.
